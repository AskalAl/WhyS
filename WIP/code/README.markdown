I've always enjoyed finding websites that use the konami code, so i took it upon myself to learn how to implement it and commented along the way. Also includes another idea i worked on using variables and setIntervals to display certain data. (the key is "up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a, enter" on your keyboard)
